# Making a new WG repo

1. Create the repo using the name of the WG

2. Create a team of committers using name of WG and apending committers

2. Make the WG chair administrators of the team (TODO)

3. Make sure the README has the correct NOTE WELL and Contributing text

4. Decide how you will work, can just a few people merge PR from forks or will you have lots of people that write to the repo

5. Add directories for each draft and put the drafts in them
